  My journey on this software engineering path has been somewhat of a strange one so far. One where I am able to get through my labs but sometimes not completely knowing how in full.

  I am able to write out my code without hesitation (not 100% of the time) and get through some of the labs in a breeze and even then, I’m not so sure how I was able to get to those conclusions. What I mean to say is, that I am not fully conscious of what I am typing out in the moment but it feels right to me. What I am conscious of though, is the great importance and need of being completely aware of what I am doing. I am aware that I need (and I really want) to have a deeper understanding of coding. 

  Where I have found this a setback is through Object Orientated Ruby. I believe this (or is it a great assumption of mine?) as it has many abstract concepts. I also have the tendency to skim through the READMEs and jump straight into the IDE to complete the labs. Whilst going through ‘Class Variables and Methods’, I was acting upon this tendency and wasn’t going anywhere. I then stopped. Started to reflect. Then came to a conclusion that the only way I can get through the lab is to put my ego to the side by reading carefully and asking for help. 

  Flatiron READMEs are great and help so much, however I took them for granted. The ‘Ask a Question’ is such a great platform to gain help but I avoid it more than I should be doing. The videos from Avi are very informative but I did not fully absorb the knowledge and I’m sorry that. Now I’m trying to be more conscious to understand the knowledge and allow myself to implement it without running into the same hurdles!
